# Flow for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds [Flow](http://flowtype.org) support for VS Code. Flow is a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs.

## Which Flow Extension Should I Use?

### This Extension

This extension is a direct clone of the official flow-team project, published [with permission](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/issues/25), until such time as the official extension is republished.

*Please be aware that this extension will likely be unpublished from the marketplace as soon as that takes place!*

### Flow Language Support

The official flow-team-supported extension is [Flow Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowtype.flow-for-vscode).  It is built directly upon and maintained in line with Nuclide code (Facebook's in-house js/flow IDE).  Unfortunately, while the project is still being actively maintained, updates have not been published to the VS Code extension marketplace since version 0.0.2.

### vscode-flow

[vscode-flow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rtorr.vscode-flow) is a third-party extension under active development built completely independently of Nuclide.
